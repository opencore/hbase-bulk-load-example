# HBase Bulk Load Example

This project should be a template for HBase Bulk Load Jobs using MapReduce.

It will _not_ work out of the box. One reason for this is that the business logic in the mapper is not implemented and the Driver doesn't set an InputFormat or any input data.

It is coded against the HBase 1.4.1 API.

*Warning*: This is untested. Feedback welcome.
